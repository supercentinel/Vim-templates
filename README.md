# Vim-Templates

This is a plugin intended for saving time typing or copy and pasting
from other sources. Right now is more like a snippet plugin.

## Causes

I created this plugin to help me avoiding coping and pastig from other files.
I tried to use the plugin of [nvimdev](https://github.com/nvimdev) but didn't work as i still use a vimscript init file.

As such i tried to implement the same features from is [plugin](https://github.com/nvimdev/template.nvim)

## Instalation

For using this plugin install with a plugin manager

## Usage

For using this plugin you need to set up some variables in your `.vimrc/vim.init`

`let g:template_dir`: for specifing the directory where you store your templates
`let g:name` for the author name substitution in the templates
`let g:email` for inserting your designated email in your template

## Example

The primary use i will give this plugin is for rapidly creating templates(duh)
for C++ and $\LaTeX$ documents: here's are the examples
